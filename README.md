<h3 align="center">Power usage data analysis</h3>
<p align="left">
    This is project about power usage data analysis. the data is real data of a Tranformer Area with 115 Customer. The enegry data is measured by smart electronic meters (Meter). The data from meter is collected by a Terminal via PLC (Power Line Control Technology) one time per day include:
    <br>
        + Voltage U(V),
    <br>
        + Current I(A),
    <br>
        + Forward Active Energy A+(KWh)
    <br>
        + Forward ReActive Energy R+(KWh)
    <br>
        + Reverse Active Energy A-(KWh)
    <br>
        + Reverse ReActive Energy R-(KWh)
    <br>
    With multi tariff meter it have more data of each tariff :
    <br>
        + Forward Active Energy tariff 1 A+(KWh)
    <br>
        + Forward Active Energy tariff 2 A+(KWh)
    <br>
        + Forward Active Energy tariff 3 A+(KWh)
    <br>
        + Forward ReActive Energy tariff 1 R+(KWh)
    <br>
        + Forward ReActive Energy tariff 2 R+(KWh)
    <br>
        + Forward ReActive Energy tariff 3 R+(KWh)
    <br>
        + Reverse Active Energy tariff 1 A-(KWh)
    <br>
        + Reverse Active Energy tariff 2 A-(KWh)
    <br>
        + Reverse Active Energy tariff 3 A-(KWh)
    <br>
        + Reverse ReActive Energy tariff 1 R-(KWh)
    <br>
        + Reverse ReActive Energy tariff 2 R-(KWh)
    <br>
        + Reverse ReActive Energy tariff 3 R-(KWh)
    <br>
